# sandbox

Welcome to my public sandbox! I have a lot of little experiments I want to share, but I don't like the idea of dedicating an entire repo to an experiment. So this is my middle-ground. A place where I can share bits of code with lower pressure. Enjoy!

Each subdirectory includes a readme to further explain things.
